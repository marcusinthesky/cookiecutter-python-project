## Quarto Authoring Guide  
This document provides comprehensive instructions for working with Quarto (.qmd) files in this repository. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that renders plain text markdown and executable code into high-quality, professional documents in formats like HTML, PDF, and MS Word.A Quarto document is composed of three fundamental parts:
1. YAML Header: A metadata block at the top of the file for configuration.
2. Markdown Text: Narrative content using Pandoc-flavored Markdown.
3. Code Chunks: Executable blocks of code in languages like Python, R, or Julia.

## 1. YAML Header
The YAML header is enclosed by --- at the very top of the file. It controls document-level settings like the title, author, output format, and other rendering options.
**Syntax Example:**
```yaml
title: "Analysis Report"
author: "Your Name"
format:
    html:
        toc: true
        code-fold: true
        number-sections: true
    pdf:
        documentclass: article
    jupyter: python3
```

## 2. Markdown and Text Formatting

Quarto uses Pandoc Markdown, which supports all standard Markdown syntax. Always use a blank line before starting a list.

| Style | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Heading | `# H1`, `## H2` | `# My Title` |
| Bold | `**text**` | `**Important**` |
| Italic | `*text*` | `*emphasized*` |
| Unordered List | `- item` | `- First point` |
| Ordered List | `1. item` | `1. First step` |
| Link | `[text](url)` | `(https://quarto.org)` |

## 3. Executable Code

Quarto's power comes from its ability to execute code and embed the results directly into the final document.

### Code Chunks

Code chunks are fenced code blocks that specify a language. The code is executed during rendering, and its output (including plots, tables, and text) is included in the document.

**Syntax:**
Code snippet#| label: fig-matplotlib-plot
#| fig-cap: "A simple Matplotlib plot."

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.show()

### Chunk Options (`#|`)

Chunk options are specified using special comments at the top of a code chunk, starting with `#|` (a "hash-pipe"). This is the standard and preferred syntax in Quarto.

**Common Chunk Options:**
*   `label`: A unique identifier for the chunk, essential for cross-referencing (e.g., `fig-myplot`, `tbl-summary`).
*   `echo`: Set to `false` to hide the source code in the output document. Defaults to `true`.
*   `eval`: Set to `false` to prevent the code from being executed. The code will still be displayed (unless `echo: false`).
*   `include`: Set to `false` to execute the code but include neither the code nor its output in the final document.
*   `fig-cap`: A caption for a figure generated by the chunk.
*   `code-fold`: Set to `true` to make the code block collapsible in HTML output.

### Inline Code

To dynamically insert computed values directly into your narrative text, use inline code. The syntax uses a single backtick followed by the language identifier in braces.

**Syntax Example:**
The dataset contains `{python} len(my_dataframe)` rows.

## 4. Quarto-Specific Features

Quarto extends standard Markdown with powerful features for technical and scientific documents.

### Callouts

Use callouts to draw attention to important information. They are created using a div block `:::` with a `.callout-*` class.

**Syntax Example:**
:::{.callout-note}
This is an important note. The content inside this block will be styled as a note.
:::

:::{.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Collapsible Warning
This is a collapsible warning. The content is hidden by default.
:::
Available types include `.callout-note`, `.callout-tip`, `.callout-warning`, `.callout-important`, and `.callout-caution`.

### Layouts (Columns and Tabsets)

Organize content into more complex layouts like columns or tabs.

**Columns Syntax:**
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
Content for the left column.
:::
:::{.column width="40%"}
Content for the right column.
:::
:::

**Tabsets Syntax:**
:::{.panel-tabset}
### Tab A
Content for the first tab.

### Tab B
Content for the second tab.
:::

### Cross-References

Automatically number and link to figures, tables, equations, and sections. To create a cross-reference, you must first add a `label` to the code chunk that generates the output.

**Syntax Example:**
As shown in @fig-matplotlib-plot, the trend is upward.
This will create a numbered link (e.g., "Figure 1") to the plot generated by the chunk with the label `fig-matplotlib-plot`.

### Code Annotation

Add numbered annotations to specific lines of code to provide detailed explanations. Add a comment with `<n>` at the end of a code line and follow the code block with a corresponding numbered list.

**Syntax Example:**
`{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # 
df['new_col'] = df['old_col'] * 2 # 
```

1.  Load the dataset from a CSV file.
2.  Create a new column by performing a calculation.
By following these guidelines, you will ensure that all Quarto documents in this repository are consistent, reproducible, and easy to maintain.
